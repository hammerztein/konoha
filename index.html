						<h1>Konohagakure</h1>
						<p>
							Konohagakure - (English: "Village Hidden in the Leaves" or "Hidden
							Leaf Village", literally meaning: Village Hidden by Tree Leaves)
							is the hidden village of the Land of Fire. As the village of one
							of the Five Great Shinobi Countries, Konohagakure has a Kage as
							its leader known as the Hokage, of which there have been eight in
							its history. Konoha resides deep within a forest at the base of a
							mountain known as the Hokage Rock, which has the faces of all
							those who have taken the office of Hokage engraved on it.[1] It is
							surrounded on all sides by enormous walls.
